# NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ
Normative Network Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Network and Transcriptomic Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia. The docker for sulci-processing, the corresponding sulcal parcellation in 'fsaverage' space as well as the minimalistic sulci visualisation software were adapted from [Snyder et al. 2024](https://www.cell.com/neuron/article/S0896-6273(24)00568-3/fulltext). For normative modelling we created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). Spatial correlations were corrected for by spin tests using code from [Váša et al. 2018](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/1/281/4566607?login=false). The Q-Q plots for all included sulci can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_Sulci/tree/main/Q-Q%20plots).
