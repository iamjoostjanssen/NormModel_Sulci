# NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ
Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia. We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). The Q-Q plots for all included sulci can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_Sulci/tree/main/Q-Q%20plots).
